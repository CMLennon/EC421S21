# EC 421, Spring 2021

Welcome to **Economics 421: Introduction to Econometrics** part II, *electric boogaloo* (Spring 2021) at the University of Oregon (taught by Connor Lennon.) Great thanks
go to Edward Rubin for inspiring these slides and designing the course content. See his work [here](https://edrub.in).

For information on the course specifics, please see the [syllabus](https://raw.githack.com/CMLennon/EC421S21/main/Syllabus/Econ421-Lennon-S21.pdf).

## Lecture slides

The slides below (linked by their topic) are .html files that will only work properly if you are connected to the internet. 
If you're going off grid, grab the PDFs (you'll miss out on gifs and interactive plots, but the equations will render correctly). 
I create the slides with [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki) in [R](cran.r-project.org) and borrow heavily from Ed Rubin's existing material.
